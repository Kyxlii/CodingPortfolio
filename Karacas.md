# Karacas encryption program

This was a small project we were given to encrypt entered text according to a specific rule set:
<ul>
  <li>The word is reversed.</li>
  <li>The vowels are encrypted into numbers (a -> 0, e -> 1, i -> 2, o -> 2, u -> 3)</li>
  <li>"aca" is appended to the end of each word</li>
</ul>
Because of this rule set, decryption is not applicable without applying a dictionary and creating essentially my own spell checker, which while that would be great learning experience, isn't something I think belongs with this task.
